# FindaBull
A collaborative platform built by a dynamic duo during a hackathon! ðŸš€ Fronted by ReactJS and backed by the power of C#, our site's mission is to bridge the gap between talented coders and visionary idea-havers. Seamlessly connect and collaborate to turn innovative concepts into reality!

## Inspiration
It's always tough to find talented programmers to bring your crazy ideas to life, while experienced programmers often struggle to find creative projects that excite and challenge them, not just during hackathons.

## What it does
Our web application collects project ideas and descriptions from brainstormers and shows them to talented and experienced programmers, who can apply to participate in them. After a match is found, we automatically send an email with a short CV to the project publisher, so they can decide who they want to work with.
